# Explorations, obsessions and dalliances
- Experience of being arrested (possibly needs clearing with a lawyer 🙈)
- "[The open internet is dead](https://pca.st/episode/ffc7696f-74fe-45ea-8055-6460693953cf)" - I have an audio file with ramblings about this
- How to write GitHub README.md files

## My mission
Crafting company culture, structure and practice for creating high-performing digital services

## Identity, belonging, ownership, purpose
- individual Vs social
- high-performing groups (tribes?)
    - what of "tradition"?
    - transformative people of the past, and their groups
- "dear England" letter
- make a mind-map
    - relevance to individualism Vs community; personal empowerment, agency, psychology; obvious relevance to queerism; relevance to nationalism
- my work leading MT to high-performance
- identity Vs "competition" as a performance theory
- helping the left lean into crafting social identity
    - is the right better at this?

This is currently an experiment. And it's all [Tris's fault](https://decapsulate.com/episodes/3/).

It was surprisingly easy to set up though. I'd not used Vercel before - it's quite neat. And it seems to let me host it under a custom domain for free. I wonder what their profit model is?
## Blogging ideas

## LLMs are not junior developers
Talking to an LLM is more like talking to someone completely new in your team every time you have a conversation.
- Huge incentive to have really clear onboarding documentation
- Working with an LLM is like working with a contractor
