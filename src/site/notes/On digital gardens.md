Because of [Tris](https://decapsulate.com/episodes/3/), I'm experimenting with cultivating a Digital Garden. It might be just the ticket.

# Etymology: Where the "digital garden" term came from
Maggie Appleton's authoritative "[A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)" highlights two important inflection points in history:
- Mark Bernstein’s 1998 "[Hypertext Gardens](http://www.eastgate.com/garden/Enter.html)" essay
- Mike Caufield's 2015 "The Garden and the Stream: a Technopastoral" [keynote speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckv_CjyKyZY) and [essay](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/)

And according to Appleton:

> If anyone should be considered the original source of _digital gardening_, it’s Caufield.

- Tom Critchlow’s 2018 "[Of Digital Streams, Campfires and Gardens](https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/10/10/of-gardens-and-wikis/)"

# What "digital garden" means



# Terminology
## [Streams](https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/10/10/of-gardens-and-wikis/#stream-campfires-and-gardens)
Fast twitch information discovery happens. The firehose of content. But with an undercurrent of creating new connections.

## Campfires

## Gardens



# Set up

It was surprisingly easy to set up, following the default instructions, using [a GitHub repo](https://github.com/nottrobin/garden.robinwinslow.uk) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). I'd not used Vercel before - it's quite neat. It seems to let me host it under a custom domain for free.

But maybe if I wrote my own Github Action to publish to [Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) then it wouldn't break so much, or at least, I wouldn't be so surprised when it did.

I did a [quick search](https://www.jobaajlearnings.com/blog/github-pages-vs-vercel-which-platform-should-you-choose-for-hosting) to compare the two:

> If you're looking to host a simple static website, personal portfolio, or blog, **GitHub Pages** is an excellent and cost-effective option. It integrates well with GitHub repositories and offers an easy deployment process.
> 
> On the other hand, if you require more advanced features like serverless functions, better performance, or support for modern frameworks, **Vercel** is the superior choice.

I certainly don't need "serverless functions" or "support for modern frameworks" - in that I'd prefer to write my own pipeline. I would like "better performance", and Vercel did publish quickly *when it worked*. But it broke a lot, and I did see people out on the web complaining that they'd hit its publish limits.

So I'll try switching to GitHub Pages soon, when I get a sec.
## Themes
I'd like to find a theme explorer for Digital Garden. They have documentation on themes, but no page that I could find showing you what they all look like.
