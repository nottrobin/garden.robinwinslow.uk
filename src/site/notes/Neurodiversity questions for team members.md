# The questions
1. Tell me about yourself and how you like to do work
2. What are your strengths and what are your least preferred tasks?
3. Do you have a disability, or need any adjustments I should be aware of?
4. What are your developmental goals or career ambitions?
5. What the best way to communicate with you?
    - (E.g. email, ad-hoc/scheduled phone call, zoom, messenger etc.)
    - Be aware that for some people, phone calls are very difficult, or emails may disappear to the bottom of a full inbox never to be seen again
6. How do you prefer tasks to be allocated?
    - Don't assume everybody will be able to use your method. They may need more context in writing. They may prefer to collect tasks throughout the week and then meet with you to discuss. Etc.
7. If I notice that something is not getting done which I think should be, how would you like me to bring it to your attention?
8. How do you prefer feedback? Balance of positive and negative strokes etc.
9. Is there anything that really matters to you that I should be aware of?
    - e.g. 'planning and details put me under pressure, I prefer to be flexible' or conversely 'I find uncertainty difficult and don't like it when plans change' etc.
10. Can we agree how you will let me know if you are struggling before things go wrong?
### My addition
11. Do you feel excluded in any way? How can we include you?
