Mostly drawn from [Maggie Appleton's history](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history):

# 2015-10-16: *The Garden and the Stream: a Technopastoral* [keynote speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckv_CjyKyZY) and [essay](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/) by Mike Caufield

A lot of what he says here is connected to Zettlekasten - he's extracting concepts to be links in a knowledge graph

> And I get really excited, because I remember the Suicide Belt article I wrote six months ago, and realize that would be a perfect link. So I link to it and read it again. And what I’m trying to do now is think about what sentence I put in front of the link. I’m thinking about how I define the relation.
