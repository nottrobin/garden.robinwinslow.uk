``` mermaid
mindmap
  root((Me))
    Big systems thinking
        Clear strategic vision
        Spot patterns and connections
        Principle-oriented
    Direct
        Like one-to-ones
        Authentic
        Speak my mind
        Can be abrasive
    Bad at routine
        Struggle to stick to structure
        Chaotic delivery
        Overwhelmed by too many tasks
    Enthusiastic, obsessive
        Taking notes helps me think
        Enthusiastically interrupt
        Sometimes take over
```
