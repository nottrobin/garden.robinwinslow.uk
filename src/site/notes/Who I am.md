As far as I know, I have existed since 1984, and I've been called Robin ever since.

My surname has been Winslow Morris since at least the 80s. I should probably find out more about that - official forms ask if I've ever been formally known under a different name, and it's possible I was when I was tiny and I've been lying.
# I am a father
I've officially been a father since 2018, but I feel I've identified as a future father since I was in my teens. And I now have two children.
# I am divorced
I am (nearly) [divorced and proud](https://www.oprahdaily.com/life/relationships-love/a63688330/divorce-experience-facts/).
# I am a feminist
# I am English, British, European and Human


# I am a leftist
I found [a good definition of leftism](https://rosesandresistance.substack.com/p/what-is-leftism):

> Fundamentally, leftism is about redistributing power—whether economic, social, or political—to create a more equitable society.

This is a better general description of my core ideology than socialism, syndicalism, Marxism, communism etc., which more-or-less describe strategic focuses in the journey towards a more egalitarian world. Leftism describes the core belief in egalitarianism.
# I am male
Although I loosely identify as a [man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man), I treat many classic tropes of [masculinity](https://helpfulprofessor.com/types-of-masculinity/) with scepticism - especially [Stoicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism) and [Rationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalism).
# I am white and privileged
