Like how MediaWiki, Stack Overflow or Jekyll (maybe only 'cos of GitHub?) were definitive in illustrating concepts for new types of solutions.

We should strive to create the most definitive version of a concept, as simply as possible, to illustrate how it could then be taken and implemented by many others.

I want to do this with a git-based (or, at least, diff-based) live-editable Wiki, to become a digital garden.
