- "I statements" are good
    - Focus on describing your own experience, not other people's
- Take a break from tough conversations
    - Breaks are always good
- Send a written follow-up
    - To reassure & get on the same page
- Practice recognising emotional dysregulation
    - Fight or flight instincts
    - Someone may become overly argumentative, or withdraw and shut down
    - Rational control goes out the window
