As I write this, 86% of the vote in the New York mayoral election has been counted. There's now no doubt - every sensible expert has long since resoundingly called the race for Zohran Mamdani.

This was also mostly a foregone conclusion. Zohran smashed Cuomo in the primary, and so his repeat of that performance was expected. Still, Mamdani's win has *huge* implications, across the globe.

Zohran Mamdani has achieved something absolutely incredible. To become mayor, he had to simultaneously defeat Zionists & the Israel lobby; neoliberals & the Democratic National Committee; MAGA & the White House; and the media establishment.

He deliberately championed diversity and leaned into his New York muslim identity, at a time when islamophobia is at an all-time high. He unapologetically called out the Gaza genocide, survived Israel's significant political cloud,Israel's sig while skilfully turning the "jihadist" attacks back on his attackers. He subverted the relentless "centrist" and zionist bias of the media giants.

He strongly defended himself and New York against Trump's direct threats. He defended himself against the Democratic party's brazen opposition - Chuck Schumer will walk away from this election significantly weaker.

Zohran provides the left with authoritative lessons in political strategy, and all the most promising leftist rising stars have been taking many leaves out of his playbook:

- We can loudly and proudly explain that leftists are *for the people*, and leftist ideas are *popular*
- We *win* when we unapologetically defend our principles, and oppose genocide
- We must *do our homework* to boldly engage with the media, and win the debates

At the same time, his rise and win illustrates a significant shift in political momentum, within the USA and beyond:

The impact of Mamdani's win on the Gaza genocide could be transformative. It's now clearer than ever that supporting Gaza & opposing Israel is a winning political strategy. It's especially worth remembering that the UN headquarters are in New York, and Mamdani has clearly stated that if Netanyahu steps foot in New York while he is mayor, he will be arrested as a war criminal.

In the country, and one of the cities, that are global leaders of capitalism, Zohran's win shows that free-market capitalism and neoliberal economics have significantly lost their sway.

And for Mamdani to have prevailed so impressively clearly shows that the power of the American nationalism movement is waning.

This is why, for example, Zach Polanski - "[The British Mamdani](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-8W6td3zwg)" - is so clearly styled in his image.
