# Support psychological safety
- No blame culture
- Growth mindset
    - Challenges are opportunities for learning and growth
- A person is never "performing poorly"
    - They're either learning, with support, or they're in the wrong job
    - If someone can't do something they "should", be neuro-curious
- Body doubling
    - Shadow or pair up with people to help them get tough tasks done
# "Be neuro-curious"
- Supporting people requires being interested and brave (but respectful) about discussing sensitive personal topics
# Respect & empowerment
- "Names not titles" - don't mention grade
- Listen - not every conversation is for problem solving
    - "I promise not to interrupt you...."
# Holding tough conversations
- "I statements" are good
    - Focus on describing your own experience, not other people's
- Take a break from tough conversations
    - Breaks are always good
- Send a written follow-up
    - To reassure & get on the same page
- Practice recognising emotional dysregulation
    - Fight or flight instincts
    - Someone may become overly argumentative, or withdraw and shut down
    - Rational control goes out the window
