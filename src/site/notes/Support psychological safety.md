- No blame culture
- Growth mindset
    - Challenges are opportunities for learning and growth
- A person is never "performing poorly"
    - They're either learning, with support, or they're in the wrong job
    - If someone can't do something they "should", be neuro-curious
- Body doubling
    - Shadow or pair up with people to help them get tough tasks done
